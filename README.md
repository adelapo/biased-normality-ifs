# IFS Visualization Code

This repository holds programs written in Python and Processing for visualizing the attractors of iterated function systems with different sequences as input. My paper *Bernoulli Randomness and Biased Normality* is available as a pre-print on arXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01854. The paper cites this repository, and specifically the Processing code in it, as the code which generated the images appearing in the paper. More recently, I added a Python version of the visualization code with a user interface and detailed documentation. I might continue to add features to this Python code and the documentation. The documentation is in a PDF in the repository here: https://github.com/adelapo/biased-normality-ifs/blob/master/code_documentation.pdf.
